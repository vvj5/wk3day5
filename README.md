This Program Can:

-Create a Currency object with an amount and a currency code

-Create a Currency object equal another Currency object with the same amount and currency code

-Create a Currency object that does NOT equal another Currency object with different amount or currency code

-Create a Currency object that can be added to another Currency object with the same currency code

-Create a Currency object that can be subtracted by another Currency object with the same currency code

*work in progress* Should raise a DifferentCurrencyCodeError when you try to add or subtract two Currency objects with different currency codes.



This program, when complete, should ALSO be able to:

Currency objects:

Should be created with an amount and a currency code

Should equal another Currency object with the same amount and currency code

Should NOT equal another Currency object with different amount or currency code

Should be able to be added to another Currency object with the same currency code

Should be able to be subtracted by another Currency object with the same currency code

Should raise a DifferentCurrencyCodeError when you try to add or subtract two Currency objects with different currency codes.

Should be able to be multiplied by a Fixnum or Float and return a Currency object

CurrencyConverter objects:

Should be initialized with a Hash of currency codes to conversion rates (see link to rates below)

At first, just make this work with two currency codes and conversation rates, with one rate being 1.0 and the other being the conversation rate. An example would be this: {USD: 1.0, EUR: 0.74}, which implies that a dollar is worth 0.74 euros.

Should be able to take a Currency object that has one currency code it knows and a requested currency code and return a new Currency object with the right amount in the new currency code. For example: currency_converter.convert( Currency.new(10, :USD), :EUR ) == Currency.new(7.40, :EUR)

Should be able to be created with a Hash of three or more currency codes and conversion rates. An example would be this: {USD: 1.0, EUR: 0.74, JPY: 120.0}, which implies that a dollar is worth 0.74 euros and that a dollar is worth 120 yen, but also that a euro is worth 120/0.74 = 162.2 yen.

Should be able to convert Currency in any currency code it knows about to Currency in any other currency code it knows about.

Should raise an UnknownCurrencyCodeError when you try to convert from or to a currency code it doesnâ€™t know about.
